Data files fori: "A non-equilibrium slurry model for planetary cores 
with application to Earthâ€™s F-layer"

This is intended to be downloaded alongside the code (from github)
using the pooch python module. See the main github README file
for instructions.

Inside this repository is a runbatch.sh script that will run
all cases in folders called i0* as long as they contain 
a parameters.yaml file (input parameters), a grid.in file
(list of DT and DX to apply to build multiple input 
temperature and compositon profiles) and a run.sh
script (that actually does the running. 

Example input can be found in the template directory.

Input and output for all cases can be found in directories
starting i0 ... these are not stored in github but can be
obtained using pooch. Seting up cases to run otherwise can
be done with a shell script and some regular expressions.
