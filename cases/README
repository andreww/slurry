Cases for: "A non-equilibrium slurry model for planetary cores 
with application to Earthâ€™s F-layer"

The command line programme used to run a single set of cases 
(fixed parameters, but a grid search over DT and DX looking 
for "Earth like" models) is `layer_models.py` in the outer directory
which is intended to run in a directory and populate this with output
for different temperature and composition profiles. These directories
(and the input parameter sets) are set up by `run_cases.py` in this directory
which copies and modifies the files in `cases/template`
before launching the shell script `cases/template/run.sh`. It takes a week or two 
(on a M1 Mac Min in serial) to run all cases and this process generates approx
4 GB of data once compressed. We do not include this data alongside the code.
It is possible to run multiple instances of run_cases - they will try not to
run the same set of parameters twice (but the approach to do this is not very robust).
