    "What defines equilibrium? \n",
    "1. Thermal Equilibrium: $T_S=T_L$ at the mutual interface (LR87 eqn 4.55). They also suggest at the start of section 4.3.1. that $F\\Rightarrow\\infty$ is required but we don't know what $F$ is. I think its in 4.45 and is something to do with entropy. \n",
    "2. Chemical equilibrium: $\\mu_S = \\mu_L$. Since $T$ and $p$ are equilibrated and flow near the surface of the solid is inhibited this is governed by diffusion in the chemical BLs on their side of the interface. \n",
    "3. Phase equilibrium: $\\Lambda = \\infty$. At phase equilibrium the rate of formation of solid will match the rate of destruction of solid because the total free energy will be minimised. That is to say, the volume of solid and the volume of liquid will be determined by applying the leaver rule to the phase diagram. This is what Sun is giving us below. The timescale is the sum of growth and nucleation timescales. The solid fraction is fixed and this is composed of $N$ particles: How long does it take to nucleate these $N$ particles and grow them to their equilibrium size? \n",

    "Notes for items (1) and (2) are in the notebook on  [falling timescales](./falling_timescale.ipynb). The notes on item (3) are below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ins>(3): Phase equilibrium</ins>: Equilibrium conditions give the volume fraction $V_E(T)$ of solid that corresponds to the state where chemical potentials in the solid and liquid are equal. However, there are an infinity of ways to partition $V_E$ between $N$ particles of radius $r$; the end-member cases are a large number of small particles and a small number of large particles. Additional information is needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will assume that the inner core is built from snow leaving the base of the F-layer. The snow is assumed to fall at the Stokes velocity $V_s$. We will assume that the inner core growth rate $d r_i / dt$ is given. Then the total volume change in time $d t$ is $d V / d t = 4\\pi r_i^2 (d r_i /dt)$. The volume change (assuming spherical growth) is the number of particles flowing to the ICB at the Stokes velocity, which is $\\frac{4\\pi r^3}{3} N P V_s$, where the packing fraction $P=0.69$ for spheres. The two conditions corresponding to phase equilibrium and inner core growth are then\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V_E(T) = \\frac{4 \\pi r^3 N}{3} (1) , \\quad \\frac{4\\pi r^3}{3} N P V_s = 4\\pi r_i^2 \\frac{d r_i}{dt} (2) ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $V_s$ is the generalised Stokes velocity as defined in Zhang and Xu (2002 - see below). Note that $r$ is not eliminated between these two equations because $V_s$ contains factors of $r$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To undertake the calculation there is the additional constraint that the particles must fall a maximum distance $\\Delta r$ corresponding to the F-layer depth slower than the timescale required to reach phase equilibrium. If this is not true then the assumptions underlying the calculation (for a given IC growth rate) are incorrect. This comes into the calculation via $V_E$, which is actually the volume of solid in equilibrium divided by the total volume (i.e. the volume containing particles that can make it to the ICB). \n",
    "\n",
    "For a given $\\Delta r$ and the $V_s$ obtained from equations (1) and (2) we can estimate the time $\\tau_f$ it takes the particles to fall to the ICB. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact equation (1) is actually $M$ constraints, one for each temperature $T(r)$. This is a problem because the second equation is only one constraint. To show this, consider that the F-layer is comprised of 2 levels, each with equilibrium volume, mean particle radius and mean particle number denoted $V_i$, $r_i$ and $N_i$ respectively, with $i = 1, 2$. The equations then become\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V_1 = \\frac{4 \\pi r_1^3 N_1}{3}$$ \n",
    "$$ V_2 = \\frac{4 \\pi r_2^3 N_2}{3}$$ \n",
    "$$\\frac{4\\pi r_1^3}{3} N_1 P V_{s1} + \\frac{4\\pi r_2^3}{3} N_2 P V_{s2} = 4\\pi r_i^2 \\frac{d r_i}{dt} ,$$\n",

    "There are now 4 unknowns ($N_i$ and $R_i$) but only 3 equations. Further constraints are needed, but at present we are not sure what they are. \n",

    "$$\\tau_E(r,N) = \\tau_N + \\tau_G $$\n",

    "Problem here is that $\\tau_N$ is the probability of nucleating 1 particle and we need the probability of nucleating $N$ particles. For $\\tau_G$ we need to account for the fact that not all particles nucleate at the same time.  \n",

At small r we will need many particles and so the time should be dominated by nucleation. At large radius, we will need fewer particles but they will need more time to grow, so time should be dominated by growth. In either case, the first thing we need is a function to give us the time to make a number of nuclei at a given temperature.
