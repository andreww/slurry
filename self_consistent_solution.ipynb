    "## Non-equilibrium calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "For the overall non-equilibrium calculation we make use of the previously implemented\n",
    "code to track the growth and falling velocity of an isolated crystal. The innovation\n",
    "is in bringing these together into a model of the F-layer. Setup of the F-layer is\n",
    "described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The particle density and optimisation of the interaction volume\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far we have treated the 'interaction volume' around the falling particles as an\n",
    "externally imposed parameter. However, we would like the composition (in terms of \n",
    "oxygen content) of the F-layer to be conserved. While the composition inside each\n",
    "interaction volume is conserved by construction, we also need to ensure that these\n",
    "volumes do not intersect. If this is not the case we end up with regions of the\n",
    "F-layer where the composition is doubly (and inconsistently) defined. If this is\n",
    "not the case, the total layer composition is constrained by construction and it is\n",
    "easy to evaluate the average liquid composition by noting its volume is just the\n",
    "volume of the layer with the volume of solid particles removed, and that all the \n",
    "oxygen is in the liquid. The problem with this line of attack is that the growth\n",
    "rate of the falling particles, and thus their spacing, depends on the size of the\n",
    "interaction region. Furthermore, if the interaction volumes don't fill space we\n",
    "will have regions of the layer between interaction volumes with reduced oxygen\n",
    "content compared to the interaction volumes. It thus seems that our interaction\n",
    "volumes should fill space and we end up with no flux boundary conditions halfway\n",
    "between each growing particle. In order to set this up we need to self consistently\n",
    "solve the falling particles ODEs using the following algorithem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set an initial guess for the interaction volume radius\n",
    "2. Solve ODEs \n",
    "3. Calculate spacing between particles\n",
    "4. If spacing does not equal radius update radius and repeat from 2 otherwise\n",
    "5. Evaluate mean oxygen content of liquid, crystal size distribution and inner core growth rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for many falling particles nucleating throughout the layer the volume\n",
    "radius will need to change through the layer (we may expect it will decrease as the\n",
    "number density of particles increases downwards). We thus need to set the interaction\n",
    "volume radius as a parameterised function (analogously to the temperature).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the above, we need a way to evaluate the number density of particles at any\n",

I am not quite sure about $V_n$ - is this the interaction volume at the initial location of the particle, i.e. centred at $r_n$. In this case I believe $V_n = V_n(r_n)$. If these two points are true then I think $\\tau$ is the ``mean waiting time between nucleation events at $r_n$''. </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Particles falling from any given location will follow identicle trajectories whatever time they start (because we are assuming the F-layer is in steady state. <b> CD - Is this not simply true because the particles are assumed to fall vertically down>? Perhaps ``trajectory'' is the wrong word. </b>). That is, if $r_p(r_n, t)$ and $R(r_n, t)$ are solutions to the IVP for a particle nucleating at $t_0$, solutions for an IVP where the particle nucleated at $t_0 + \\tau$ will be $r_p(r_n, t + \\tau)$ and $R(r_n, t + \\tau)$ and we have solutions available whatever the nucleation time. <b> CD - Are you saying here that the 2 particles will always be separated by the same distance as they fall? i.e. because they have the same velocity at all depths the distance travelled for particles 1 and 2 is $d_1 = Vt$ and $d_2 = V(t+\\tau) = Vt + V\\tau = d_1 + V\\tau$ such that $\\Delta d = d_1 - d_2 = V\\tau = constant$ </b>.

Also, I believe this is an average of the spacing between particles and $t_0$ and $t_0 + \\tau$ and $t_0$ and $t_0 - \\tau$. This seems reasonable.

    "I guess this is only true is the nucleation rate is always the same at $r_n$. Perhaps this is the assumption we start with, but in general N could fluctuate due to local changes in P, T, c, etc and also by the statistical nature of the process.

Not really sure how the \"stochastic\" model works. $r_n$ presumably does not vary laterally because it is just a discretisation.

    "\n",
    "We now need to consider the particles that nucleate at other depths. These will have different solutions\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The term outside the integral is the area of the ICB. The first term inside the intergral accounts for the \n",
    "spherical shell geometry, the second is the volume of the particles as they reach the ICB having nucleated\n",
    "at $r_n$, and the third term gives the number of these particles. The integral is over nucleation position.\n",

    "**To do:** do we actually implement the factor of a half in the nucleation rate?\n",

    "\n",
    "The volume fraction solid, $Vf(r)$ at any radius can be evaluated in a similar way as the total volume of solid\n",

    "**To do:** do we need a geometrical term?\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> CD - what is $V$? volume of solid divided by total volume? So $\\rho$ is number of particles per cubic metre (?) and the other piece is the particle volumes. Reads to me like you get total solid volume per m3. </b>\n",

    "of the time and particle radius when the solution hit these depths from the IVP solution objects. We run each IVP\n",
    "and store the solution objects in a list. We also need to apply small changes to the time to work out the \n",

    "We can then use the time (from the event) and apply an offset to find the position the particle was at a short time\n",

    "Event 0 is 'hit the ICB', event 1 is 'dissolved' and subsiquent events correspond to our analysis radii in order.\n",
