    "# Calculation of phase equilbrium\n",

    "This notebook outlines how to calculate phase equilbrium in the slurry zone. We\n",
    "assume a two component system (Fe and O) with one or two phases (solid and/or\n",
    "liquid) and need to be able to calculate the equilbrium volume fraction of solid\n",
    "and liquid, and the composition (oxygen fraction) of both phases as a function of\n",
    "pressure, temperature, and bulk composition. There are two ways to proceed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Parameterise the phase diagram and apply the lever rule.\n",
    "2. Parameterise the free energy and undertake free energy minimisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 1 is simple and should be quick to implement. Option 2 is more general \n",
    "(e.g. it would be easy to move to a three component system) and has the advantage\n",
    "of also giving the difference in free energy between the solid and the liquid. This\n",
    "is needed as part of classical neucleation theory and some crystal growth theories. If\n",
    "we do have the free energy we can thus make the whole thing (more) self consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now we'll start with 2."
