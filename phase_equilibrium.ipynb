    "# Calculation of phase equilbrium\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook outlines how to calculate phase equilbrium in the slurry zone. We assume a\n",
    "two component system (Fe and O) with one or two phases (solid and/or liquid). The idea is\n",
    "quite general and could cope with more than one solid phase and more than two components. I'll\n",
    "try and point out any assumptions as I go. This is all based on the `two_phase_phase_transition`\n",
    "notebook from LEMA's `common_tangent` branch. That needs cleaning up and merging properly!"

    "As input, we assume we know the free energy of the solid and liquid phases,\n",

    "At (phase) equilbrium, the volume fraction is fixed (solids neither grow or dissolve) because \n",
